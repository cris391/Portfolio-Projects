## General info
Preparing the key functionalities of our StackOverflow database.
The database must be built based on two independent data models, a QA-data model for storage of StackOverflow
QA (Question and Answer) data and a Framework model for supporting the framework (users,
markings, annotations, history). The two models should be combined into a single database when
implemented. However, it is important that the database later can be separated, if need should arise to
host these models on different servers.
